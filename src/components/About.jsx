        <p>
          "I have always been fascinated by technology, and my journey into web
          development began during my college years. After earning my degree in
          Computer Science, I decided to explore the world of web development by
          self-learning various programming languages and frameworks. Through
          consistent practice and dedication, I have successfully built several
          projects that have strengthened my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          React, Core Java, and other modern web development tools, constantly
          pushing me to grow as a developer."

        <p>
          "Over time, I gained experience working on real-world applications,
          where I developed a deep understanding of how to build user-friendly,
          responsive websites. My primary focus is always to create websites
          that are both functional and visually appealing, ensuring that users
          have an exceptional experience. In addition to front-end technologies
          like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I have also worked with Core
          Java and backend development, giving me a well-rounded approach to
          building full-stack web applications."

        <h3>Work Experience:</h3>
        <p>
          During my 3-month internship as a Web Developer (Intern/Trainee) at
          DIGLIP7 TECH PRIVATE LIMITED in Noida Sector-2, I had the opportunity
          to work on building and maintaining dynamic web applications. I
          primarily focused on developing the front-end using React.js and
          JavaScript. In addition, I collaborated with a team of developers,
          contributing to various projects that improved user experiences. I was
          responsible for debugging and optimizing code to enhance performance
          and reduce load times. This hands-on experience allowed me to deepen
          my understanding of web development, improve my problem-solving
          skills, and learn best practices for building scalable web
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my previous role as a front-end developer intern, I was responsible
          for creating interactive and visually appealing user interfaces. I
          collaborated closely with back-end developers to ensure seamless
          integration between the front-end and back-end, and gained a strong
          understanding of the full-stack development process. This experience
          helped me develop my skills in creating responsive and user-friendly
          web applications, while also learning how to effectively communicate
          and work as part of a development team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am working at Ganapati Fashions Limited, Noida Sector-62,
          where I am involved in the backend development of vending machines
          using Core Java. I am responsible for optimizing and maintaining the
          backend processes, ensuring seamless functionality and smooth user
          interactions for the vending machine systems. This experience has
          allowed me to deepen my understanding of Java programming while
          working on real-world applications.

        <h2>Passion Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Aside from professional work, I enjoy building side projects that
          allow me to experiment with new technologies and ideas. Some of my
          favorite projects include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong> EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:</strong> Employee Management
            System is a passion project where I aimed to create a robust and
            efficient web application for managing employee details in
            organizations. This system allows administrators to add, update,
            delete, and search employee records. It includes functionalities
            like managing employee data such as personal details, job roles,
            salary, and department information. Built with Core Java for the
            backend and MySQL for database management, the system provides an
            easy-to-use interface with an emphasis on simplicity and
            performance. The project not only helped me enhance my backend
            development skills but also gave me a deeper understanding of
            database management and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
            operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Polyclinic Dubai Website:</strong> Rama Care Polyclinic
            Dubai Website is a passion project where I developed a fully
            responsive and user-friendly website for a healthcare clinic. The
            website serves as an online presence for the clinic, providing
            essential information such as services offered, doctor profiles,
            appointment scheduling, and contact details. The website features a
            clean and intuitive design with a strong focus on user experience,
            allowing patients to easily book appointments and access medical
            information. I worked on the front-end development using React.js
            and integrated Firebase for real-time data management. Additionally,
            I focused on creating secure user authentication and maintaining the
            clinic's digital presence through social media integration. This
            project enhanced my skills in both front-end development and
            integrating third-party services.

          <li>
            <strong>Portfolio Website:</strong> The very website you are on
            right now! Built using React, it's a showcase of my work and a great
            way to demonstrate my skills.
